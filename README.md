# NameGenerator Project
This name generator app is a simple project used to create dummy names for UX/UI purposes. React was used to build the front end interface and Python was used for the name generation. The content is then served from a Docker container running a node.js image. I set up an Express server to handle the HTTP requests that pass information between the front-end and the back-end.
